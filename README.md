Simple and dumb as fuck script to update metadata of NFT collection on OpenSea.


### How to use

Jeez, just run fucking `main.py` file, like this:

```
python main.py
```

That's it.

### Speed

This shit takes a lot of time to update big collections, so it probably needs to be optimized, but I'll not.
